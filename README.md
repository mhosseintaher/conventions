## Conventions
Millions, maybe billions of lines of code are written every day, and each developer has his/her own way of writing.

Existence of a set of conventions is a *good to have* for developers community, but it's a ***must to have*** for each team.

These are just some conventions we set for our team, you could use which you preferred.
